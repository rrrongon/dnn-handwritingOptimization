# CDA_5125

This Folder contains all projects done in the course CDA_5125.

**Project - 1 Part 1:** 

Implementation of a Deep Big Simple Neural Nets Excel on Handwritten Digit Recognition using c/c++.

Keywords: NN (Neural Network) , MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), training set deformations, MNIST 1, BP (back-propagation).

Developed a correct vanilla implementation of a deep neural network from scratch in C or C++ that can be trained to recognize hand-written digit images.

**Project - 1 Part 2:** 

Manipulate array access pattern

Apply : loop blocking/loop interchange, loop unrolling

At least Once result in a noticeable improvement in execution time

Identify which parts of the program dominate the execution time
